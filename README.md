# Fluorish
This project is a Work-In-Progress(WIP). The resource pack is currently not available for download.
<hr>
Fluorish is a reimagining of Minecraft's art direction. With lots of changes to not only textures but models and sounds. Fluorish will also include custom entity models and animations via <a href=https://optifine.net/home> Optifine</a> or <a href=https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features>Entity Model Features</a>. Lastly, all item models are planned to be rendered in 3d!
