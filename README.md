Fluorish is a solo passion project resource pack that puts a new spin on Minecraft, redesigning most visual aspects of the game. From stylized models with added depth to visual overhauls to mobs to make them more expressive, Fluorish is meant to give a new visual refresh to the game, not fearing to stray away from the vanilla look. <br />

For custom entity textures and models to appear, you will need to install <a href=https://modrinth.com/mod/entitytexturefeatures>Entity Texture Features</a>, and <a href=https://modrinth.com/mod/entity-model-features>Entity Model Features.</a> You can also optionally use <a href=https://modrinth.com/mod/esf>Entity Sound Features</a> for custom sound events as well. <br />
<br />
For blocks to render correctly, you will either need to use the <a href=https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/texture-packs/solid-block-transparency-support>Solid Block Transparency Support</a> resource pack, or if you are using Sodium, the <a href=https://modrinth.com/mod/continuity>Continuity</a> mod. <br />

The available downloads are previews of my progress on the resource pack. Still, I would appreciate it if you could check it out!
